# TradeWorld
 A game about emergent behaviour due to trading and resources.

## Idea
The player is the trader in a world of city states. Their resource trading can turn a basic city state into a thriving metropolis, create everlasting wars, devastate cities with rampant drug problems or by blockading their supply to necessities.
